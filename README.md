# shall &mdash; introduction

A CLI and REPL for invoking shell scripts or commands with multiple POSIX-like shells for portability testing on Unix-like systems.

**`shall`** (for *sh*ell with *all* (POSIX-like) shells) offers a convenient way of running a given shell script or shell command
with a default set or specifiable set of POSIX-like shells, so as to facilitate testing of portable (POSIX-compliant, cross-shell) shell code.

By default, the following shells are targeted, if installed: **sh, dash, bash, zsh, ksh**

Additionally, you can use `shall`:

* as a REPL, with `-i`.
* in a script's shebang line.

Each shell's execution is automatically timed to allow performance comparisons.

The syntax is modeled on that of the underlying shells.

See the [Usage](#usage) chapter for details.

# Examples

```sh

# Echo the name of each executing shell; sample output included.
$ shall -c 'echo "Hello from $0."'
```
![Hello example - sample output](doc/images/example-output-hello.png)


```sh

# Pass a script to all shells via stdin, plus an argument on the command line.
echo 'echo "Passed to $0: $1"' | shall -s one

# Execute script 'foo-script' with argument 'bar' in all shells.
shall foo-script bar

# Print the type of the 'which' command in Bash and Zsh.
shall -l bash,zsh -c 'type which'

# Enter a REPL that evaluates commands in both Bash and Dash.
SHELLS=bash,dash shall -i

```

# Installation

**Supported platforms**

* When installing from the **npm registry**: all Unix-like platforms supported by Node.js.
* When installing **manually**: any **Unix-like** platform with **Bash**.

## Installation from the npm registry

With [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) or [io.js](https://iojs.org/) installed, install [the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shall) as follows:

    [sudo] npm install shall -g

**Note**:

* Whether you need `sudo` depends on how you installed Node.js / io.js and whether you've [changed permissions later](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions); if you get an `EACCES` error, try again with `sudo`.
* The `-g` ensures [_global_ installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally) and is needed to put `shall` in your system's `$PATH`.

## Manual installation

* Download [the CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mklement0/shall/stable/bin/shall) as `shall`.
* Make it executable with `chmod +x shall`.
* Move it or symlink it to a folder in your `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin` (OSX) or `/usr/bin` (Linux).

# Usage

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THE FENCED CODE BLOCK and RETAIN THIS COMMENT: The fenced code block below is updated by `make update-readme/release` with CLI usage information. -->

```
$ shall --help

SYNOPSIS
  shall [-w shellA,...] [-q|-Q] [-p opts]     script  [arg...]
  shall [-w shellA,...] [-q|-Q] [-p opts]  -c command [arg0 arg...]
  shall [-w shellA,...] [-q|-Q] [-p opts] [-s          arg...]
  shall [-w shellA,...]  -i

DESCRIPTION
  Invokes a shell script or command with multiple POSIX-like shells in
  sequence for cross-shell compatibility testing.

  Pass a *script filename* as the first operand, optionally followed by 
  arguments to pass to the script.
  If shall is in your PATH, you can also create executable scripts
  based on it by using the following shebang line:
    #!/usr/bin/env shall
  
  Use -c to specify a *command string* instead; note that the first argument
  after the command string is assigned to $0(!).
  
  Use -s to read from *stdin*; -s is optional, if no arguments are passed.
  
  Use -i to enter *interactive mode*: a simple REPL, where one command
  at a time is read from the terminal and executed.

  By default, the following shells - if installed - are targeted:
    sh, dash, bash, zsh, ksh

  To specify shells explicitly, use either of the following (in order of
  precedence):
   - Option -w shellA,...; e.g., shall -w bash,zsh ...
   - Environment variable 'SHELLS'; e.g.: SHELLS=bash,zsh shall ...

  -q, -Q
    Quiet modes: 
     -q suppresses stdout output from the command/script invoked.
     -Q suppresses both stdout and stderr.
    Note that per-shell and overall success status information is still
    reported.

  -p 
    Allows you to pass options through to the shells invoked, as a single
    argument; e.g., -p '-e -o noglob'
    Make sure all shells targeted support the specified options; all
    POSIX-like should support the same options as the `set` builtin
    (see http://is.gd/MJPvPr).

NOTES
  The exit code reflects the number of shells that reported failure; i.e.,
  it is 0 if all shells ran the command successfully.

  Output is selectively colored, but only when outputting to a terminal.
  Note that only shall's *own* errors are sent to stderr, whereas
  captured command/script output (interleaved stdout and stderr) is always
  reported via stdout.
  When outputting to a terminal and a command/script's invocation fails for a
  given shell, the (entire) output captured is printed in red.
  
  Timing information is reported for each shell.
  
  In interactive mode (-i), history is maintained in file $HOME/.shall_history
  
  To get the name of the running shell from within your code in any of the
  invocation scenarios, use:
    $(ps -o comm= $$)
  When using a command string (-c) or stdin input (-s), you can also
  use $0

EXAMPLES
    # Echo the name of each executing shell.
  shall -c 'echo "Hello from $0."'
    # Also echo the 1st argument passed.                
  echo 'echo "Passed to $0: $1"' | shall -s one
    # Execute a script, passing the -e shell option (abort on errror).
  shall -p '-e' someScript
    # Print the type of the 'which' command in bash and zsh.
  shall -w bash,zsh -c 'type which'
    # Enter a REPL that evaluates commands in both bash and dash.
  SHELLS=bash,dash shall -i
